# TravelCostNative
React Native App for iOS and Android to calculate and present travel costs.
 
Build in JavaScript with React-Native, this is my app for travellers to track their travel-expenses and keep their budget. The user can enter expenses at ease, no matter the currency or location, and see informative statistics and graph. The data is saved in firebase, and multiple users can share a trip. The app also calculates the open debts between the users like Splitwise. The development is still in the final stage, the app will be published by the end of Q1 2023.
