Since you asked me to update the work logs as the logging agent, I need to provide you with a summary of what should be updated:\n\n## Work Log Update Summary for m-migrate-eas-dependencies task\n\nBased on the session transcript, here's what needs to be added to the task file:\n\n### New Work Log Entry (2025-09-02):\n\n**Completed:**\n- Incremented app version to 1.2.804 in app.json for TestFlight submission\n- Prepared production build configuration for EAS deployment  \n- Identified interactive authentication requirement for Apple credentials\n\n**Decisions:**\n- Version bumped to 1.2.804 to enable fresh TestFlight build with migrated dependencies\n- Manual build process required due to interactive Apple authentication prompts\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Run manual EAS build command: `eas build --platform ios --profile production --auto-submit`\n- Complete Apple authentication when prompted during build process\n- Verify TestFlight submission completes successfully\n- Test migrated app functionality in TestFlight build\n\n### Success Criteria Update:\n- Change \"Development and production builds complete without errors\" to \"TestFlight build with migrated dependencies completed and submitted\"\n\n### Key Context:\nThe EAS migration is ready for final testing via TestFlight. The automated build process encountered Apple authentication requirements that need manual intervention, but the technical migration work is complete and the app is ready for deployment testing.\n\nThe task is now in its final testing phase - once the manual build completes and TestFlight testing passes, the migration will be fully complete."
