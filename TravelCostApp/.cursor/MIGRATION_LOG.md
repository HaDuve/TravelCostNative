## What Was Migrated

### State Files
- DAIC mode state: `.claude/state/daic-mode.json` → `.cursor/state/daic-mode.json`
- Task state: `.claude/state/current_task.json` → `.cursor/state/current_task.json`
- All other state files migrated

### Tasks
- Active tasks: `sessions/tasks/` → `tasks/`
- Completed tasks: `sessions/tasks/done/` → `tasks/done/`

### Configuration
- Task configuration updated to include DAIC workflow settings
- Cursor commands updated to integrate with DAIC system
- Hooks adapted for Cursor's native hook system

## New Features

### Cursor Commands
- `/create-task` - Create new tasks with context gathering
- `/start-task` - Start work on existing tasks
- `/complete-task` - Complete tasks with agent delegation

### DAIC Workflow Integration
- Discussion/Implementation mode switching
- Tool enforcement based on current mode
- Automatic trigger phrase detection
- Branch enforcement for task consistency

### Enhanced Hooks
- User message processing with DAIC detection
- Tool enforcement and branch checking
- Session startup with task context loading
- Post-tool reminders for workflow discipline

## Next Steps

1. Test the new Cursor commands: `/create-task test-task`
2. Verify task state migration: Check `.cursor/state/current_task.json`
3. Update your workflow to use Cursor commands instead of cc-sessions
4. Remove old .claude files when ready (backup created)
