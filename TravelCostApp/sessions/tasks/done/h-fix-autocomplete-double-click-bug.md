# Fix Autocomplete Suggestion Double Click Bug

## Problem/Goal

The autocomplete suggestion overlay is not working properly. Currently requires double click instead of single click to accept suggestions.

Current behavior:

1. User types text
2. Suggestion overlay appears
3. User presses suggestion once
4. Keyboard closes but suggestion overlay closes without registering the press
5. User must press suggestion again

Expected behavior:

1. User types text
2. Suggestion overlay appears
3. User presses suggestion once
4. Keyboard closes AND suggestion is accepted/applied

## Success Criteria

- [x] Identify root cause of double click requirement
- [x] Fix suggestion overlay to accept single click
- [x] Ensure keyboard closes properly when suggestion is selected
- [x] Ensure selected suggestion text is applied to input field
- [x] Test across different input components that use autocomplete
- [x] Verify fix works on both iOS and Android

## Context Files

- `components/UI/Autocomplete.tsx` - Main autocomplete component with double-click fix

## User Notes

This affects user experience significantly as autocomplete should work with single tap.

## Work Log

### 2025-09-03

#### Completed

- Identified root cause: keyboard dismiss event interfering with suggestion selection
- Implemented onTouchStart handling for immediate response to user selection
- Added 5000ms blur timeout as workaround to prevent premature menu closure
- Added isSelectingRef state tracking to manage selection lifecycle
- Tested solution across autocomplete components

#### Decisions

- Used onTouchStart instead of onPress to bypass keyboard dismiss timing issues
- Implemented 5000ms timeout as acceptable workaround for user experience
- Kept onPress as fallback for platforms that don't consume onTouchStart

#### Implementation Details

- Lines 131-150: onTouchStart handler with immediate selection processing
- Lines 74-83: Enhanced onBlur with conditional timeout and selection state checks
- Line 26: Added isSelectingRef for tracking active user selections
- Lines 136-139: Timeout cleanup to prevent conflicts

#### Next Steps

- Task completed with acceptable workaround solution
