# Fix Chart Layout and Interaction Issues

## Problem/Goal

Fix multiple issues with the Highcharts WebView implementation:

- Outer bars of bar chart are clipping with the edges of the x-axis
- Need to add native padding inside Highcharts config to the x-axis/scale
- Remove onPress behavior from both charts
- Fix tooltips, press, and longpress interactions

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Add padding to Highcharts x-axis configuration to prevent bar clipping
- [ ] Remove onPress behavior from both ExpenseChart and CategoryChart
- [ ] Verify tooltips work correctly without interfering interactions
- [ ] Test that press and longpress behaviors are properly handled or disabled as needed
