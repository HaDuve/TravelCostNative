# Turn Feedback from Email-based to Backend Entry

## Problem/Goal

Currently feedback is email-based. Need to change this to save entries directly to database under server/feedback/item/ with feedbackstring, user id, and date.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Create backend endpoint for feedback submission
- [x] Create database schema for feedback entries
- [x] Update frontend to submit to backend instead of email
- [x] Store feedback with user ID and timestamp
- [x] Remove email-based feedback system
- [x] Test feedback submission flow

## Context Manifest

### How Feedback Currently Works: Email-Based System

When a user wants to provide feedback, they interact with a button in the ProfileScreen (`screens/ProfileScreen.tsx:360-379`) labeled "Feedback?" (translated via `i18n.t("supportFeedbackLabel")`). This button opens the device's default email client with a pre-filled email to `budgetfornomads@outlook.com` with the subject "Budget For Nomads Support" and a template message "Hi, I have feedback about ...".

The current implementation uses React Native's `Linking.openURL()` with a `mailto:` URL scheme. The system checks if the device can open the URL (`canOpenURL()`) and shows an alert if no email client is available. This approach requires users to have an email client configured and relies on external email delivery.

The feedback functionality is accessible from the ProfileScreen, which serves as the primary hub for user settings and account management. The screen includes trip management features, user profile settings, and various action buttons including the feedback option. The button is implemented as a standard UI component with haptic feedback integration for improved user experience.

### For New Feature Implementation: Backend Integration

Since we're implementing a backend feedback system, we need to integrate with the existing Firebase Realtime Database architecture used throughout the app. The app follows a consistent pattern for data submission and storage that we must match.

**Authentication and Access Control:**
The app uses Firebase Authentication with secure token-based access. All backend requests include an authentication token via `getMMKVString("QPAR")` which contains the auth parameter. User identification is handled through `UserContext` which provides the current user's `uid` and other user data. The feedback submission will need to capture the authenticated user's ID to associate feedback with users.

**Database Structure Pattern:**
The Firebase Realtime Database follows a clear hierarchical structure. Examples include:

- `/users/{uid}.json` - User profile data
- `/trips/{tripid}.json` - Trip information
- `/trips/{tripid}/{uid}/expenses.json` - User expenses within trips
- `/server.json` - Server configuration data

Following this pattern, feedback should be stored at `/server/feedback/{timestamp_or_id}.json` to maintain consistency with the existing architecture.

**HTTP Communication Pattern:**
The app uses Axios for all HTTP requests with standardized patterns in `util/http.tsx`. All requests include:

- Base URL: `https://travelcostnative-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app`
- Authentication: Query parameter from `getMMKVString("QPAR")`
- Error handling: `safeLogError()` for consistent error logging
- Timeout configuration: `AXIOS_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT` for standard requests

Example submission patterns from existing code:

```typescript
// POST for creating new data
const response = await axios.post(
  BACKEND_URL + "/endpoint.json" + getMMKVString("QPAR"),
  dataObject
);
const id = response.data.name; // Firebase returns generated ID
```

**Form Component Architecture:**
The app has established form patterns in components like `ManageExpense/ExpenseForm.tsx` and `ManageProfile/ProfileForm.tsx`. Forms typically:

- Use React hooks for state management
- Include validation before submission
- Show loading states during requests
- Display success/error feedback via Toast notifications
- Include haptic feedback for user interactions
- Follow the established UI component library patterns

### Technical Reference Details

#### Required HTTP Function Signature

```typescript
export async function storeFeedback(
  feedbackData: FeedbackData
): Promise<string> {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(
      BACKEND_URL + "/server/feedback.json" + getMMKVString("QPAR"),
      feedbackData
    );
    return response.data.name; // Firebase-generated ID
  } catch (error) {
    safeLogError(error);
    throw new Error("error while storing feedback");
  }
}
```

#### Feedback Data Structure

```typescript
interface FeedbackData {
  uid: string; // From UserContext
  feedbackString: string; // User input
  date: string; // ISO timestamp
  timestamp: number; // Unix timestamp for sorting
  userAgent?: string; // Device/app info
  version?: string; // App version
}
```

#### Component Integration Points

- **ProfileScreen.tsx:360-379** - Replace mailto button with new feedback form trigger
- **UserContext** - Access current user ID (`userCtx.uid`)
- **i18n** - Use existing localization system for form labels
- **components/UI/** - Use established UI components (Button, Input, Modal)
- **util/error.ts** - Use `safeLogError()` for error handling
- **Haptics** - Include haptic feedback for form interactions

#### Database Permissions

The Firebase security rules will need to allow authenticated users to write to `/server/feedback/` path. The existing auth system should handle this automatically if the path follows established patterns.

#### File Locations

- **New HTTP function**: Add to `util/http.tsx` (line ~781)
- **New FeedbackForm component**: Create `components/FeedbackForm/FeedbackForm.tsx`
- **ProfileScreen update**: Modify `screens/ProfileScreen.tsx:360-379`
- **Type definitions**: Add to appropriate interface file or create new one
- **Internationalization**: Add feedback form strings to `i18n/supportedLanguages.tsx`

#### Error Handling Strategy

Follow the existing error handling pattern:

- Use `safeLogError()` for logging errors
- Show user-friendly error messages via Toast
- Graceful degradation if network unavailable
- Validation before submission to prevent API calls with invalid data

#### User Experience Considerations

- Replace the current email button seamlessly
- Maintain the same visual position and styling
- Add loading states during submission
- Show success confirmation via Toast
- Allow users to continue using the app immediately after submission
- Include character limits and input validation for better UX

## User Notes

Turn feedback from email based to backend-entry (should save an entry to database under server/feedback/item/(feedbackstring, user id, date).
