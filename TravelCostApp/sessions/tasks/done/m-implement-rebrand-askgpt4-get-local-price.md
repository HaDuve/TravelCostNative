# Rebrand and Improve AskGPT4 â†’ Get Local Price

## Problem/Goal

Rebrand the existing AskGPT4 feature to "Get Local Price" with improved UX, better AI model, and additional access points. The current implementation needs better branding, improved layout, updated AI capabilities, and more convenient access.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Move button from top to bottom in expenseEdit screen
- [ ] Change button icon from robot to GPT symbol (from askgpt4 screen)
- [ ] Add "Get Local Price" text to buttons
- [ ] Rebrand all GPT4 screen content to "Get Local Price"
- [ ] Implement beautiful chat bubble layout (replacing plain text presentation)
- [ ] Upgrade from outdated GPT-4 to modern model with web search capabilities
- [ ] Improve prompt and API logic for better local price detection
- [ ] Add new "Get Local Price" button in settings section
- [ ] Create TextInput Modal ("LocalPriceInput") for product input from settings
- [ ] Ensure all functionality works from both access points (expenseEdit + settings)

## Context Files

<!-- Added by context-gathering agent or manually -->

## User Notes

- Focus on budget-friendly model that supports web search and agentic research capabilities
- Chat bubble system should be output-only for now (no further user input)
- Both access points should lead to the same core functionality
- All buttons should display "Get Local Price" text
