# Replace Victory Charts with Highcharts

## Problem/Goal

Replace the current Victory charts with a comprehensive Highcharts WebView implementation. Victory charts were removed during EAS migration and need to be replaced with a robust charting solution that provides full chart functionality while maintaining good performance.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Create WebViewChart.tsx component that renders Highcharts in a WebView
- [ ] Implement controller.tsx with chart logic and data handling
- [ ] Create chartHelpers.ts utility functions for chart configuration
- [ ] Replace ExpenseChart.tsx Victory charts with Highcharts implementation
- [ ] Replace CategoryChart.tsx Victory charts with Highcharts implementation
- [ ] Implement bidirectional communication between WebView and React Native
- [ ] Support chart interactions (zoom, tap, long press)
- [ ] Handle time frame controls and data filtering
- [ ] Ensure proper WebView sizing and responsiveness
- [ ] Test chart functionality on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Remove WIPChart.tsx placeholder component

## Context Files

<!-- Added by context-gathering agent or manually -->

- components/ExpensesOverview/ExpenseChart.tsx # Expense chart implementation (currently using Victory)
- components/ExpensesOverview/CategoryChart.tsx # Category chart implementation (currently using Victory)

## User Notes

<!-- Implementation details from user -->

The implementation should follow the Highcharts WebView pattern provided:

**Project Structure:**

- WebViewChart.tsx: Main component that renders the chart
- controller.tsx: Logic and data handling
- chartHelpers.ts: Utility functions for chart configuration

**Core Components:**

- WebView loads custom HTML template with Highcharts embedded
- HTML template includes Highcharts CDN script, viewport meta tags, container div, custom styling, and initialization script

**Data Flow & Communication:**

- WebView to React Native: Using window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage for events like chart ready and zoom
- React Native to WebView: Using webViewRef.current.injectJavaScript() to update chart extremes and modify properties

**Key Implementation Details:**

- Ensure proper WebView sizing and responsiveness
- Handle loading states appropriately
- Implement error boundaries
- Consider memory management for large datasets
- Handle device rotation and resize events
- Set up bidirectional communication bridge
- Maintain smooth, interactive chart experience

The most important aspect is the bidirectional communication between React Native and the WebView using postMessage and injectJavaScript for seamless chart interaction.
