# Reduce Download Sizes Drastically

## Problem/Goal
Currently downloading entire trip expense database multiple times per day, achieving 76% of free download rate (276MB/360MB). This needs to be reduced to 25% at least, ideally down to 0.7% to avoid hitting data limits and improve performance.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Analyze current download patterns and identify redundant data transfers
- [ ] Implement incremental/delta sync instead of full database downloads
- [ ] Add data compression for network transfers
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms to avoid redundant downloads
- [ ] Reduce daily download usage from 276MB to under 90MB (25% target)
- [ ] Ideally achieve under 2.5MB daily downloads (0.7% target)
- [ ] Verify download reduction through monitoring/analytics
