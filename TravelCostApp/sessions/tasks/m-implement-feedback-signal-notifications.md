# Implement Cloud Function for Discord Notifications on Feedback

## Problem/Goal

Currently, when users submit feedback through the app, it's stored in Firebase Realtime Database but there's no real-time notification system to alert the developer. We need to implement a Firebase Cloud Function that triggers whenever new feedback is created and sends a Discord notification to the developer for immediate awareness with mobile notifications.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Set up Firebase Cloud Functions project structure
- [x] Install and configure Firebase CLI and Functions SDK
- [x] Create Cloud Function that triggers on `/server/feedback/{feedbackId}` writes
- [x] Integrate Discord webhook for sending notifications
- [x] Deploy Cloud Function to Firebase
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow: user submits feedback â†’ Discord notification sent
- [x] Handle error cases and retry logic
- [x] Configure proper Firebase security rules for function access
- [x] Document setup and deployment process
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation for future Cloud Functions development with Firebase Realtime Database

## Context Files

- @components/FeedbackForm/FeedbackForm.tsx:68-77 # Feedback submission logic
- @util/http.tsx:952-965 # storeFeedback function
- @sessions/tasks/done/m-implement-feedback-backend.md # Previous feedback implementation

## Technical Requirements

### Firebase Cloud Functions Setup

- Initialize Firebase Functions in the project
- Configure Node.js runtime and dependencies
- Set up proper Firebase project configuration
- Deploy functions to Firebase

### Discord Webhook Integration

- Use Discord webhook API for instant notifications
- Configure Discord server and webhook URL
- Handle webhook authentication and rate limiting
- Implement retry logic for failed sends
- Ensure mobile notifications are enabled

### Database Trigger Configuration

- Trigger on Firebase Realtime Database writes to `/server/feedback/{feedbackId}`
- Extract feedback data (user, message, timestamp)
- Format notification message appropriately
- Handle both new feedback creation and updates

### Error Handling & Monitoring

- Log function execution and errors
- Implement retry mechanism for Signal API failures
- Set up Firebase monitoring and alerts
- Handle edge cases (empty feedback, API timeouts)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Firebase Functions Setup

1. Install Firebase CLI globally
2. Initialize Firebase Functions in project
3. Configure `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc`
4. Set up local development environment
5. Test basic function deployment

### Phase 2: Database Trigger Implementation

1. Create function that triggers on `/server/feedback/{feedbackId}` writes
2. Extract and validate feedback data
3. Format notification message with user info and feedback content
4. Test with local Firebase emulator

### Phase 3: Discord Webhook Integration

1. Set up Discord server and create webhook
2. Configure webhook URL and permissions
3. Implement HTTP client for Discord webhook calls
4. Add retry logic and error handling
5. Test Discord message sending with mobile notifications

### Phase 4: Deployment & Testing

1. Deploy Cloud Function to Firebase
2. Test with real feedback submissions
3. Monitor function logs and performance
4. Optimize and fine-tune as needed

## Dependencies

### Firebase

- `firebase-functions` - Cloud Functions SDK
- `firebase-admin` - Admin SDK for database access
- `firebase-tools` - CLI tools

### Discord Integration

- `axios` - HTTP client for Discord webhook API
- Discord server and webhook setup

### Development

- Node.js 18+ runtime
- Firebase CLI
- Local Firebase emulator for testing

## Configuration Required

### Firebase Project

- Enable Cloud Functions in Firebase Console
- Configure billing (required for Cloud Functions)
- Set up proper IAM permissions

### Discord

- Create Discord server for notifications
- Set up webhook in Discord server
- Configure mobile notifications
- Test webhook functionality

### Environment Variables

- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` - Discord webhook URL for notifications

## Expected Message Format

Discord will receive a rich embed message with:

- **Title**: ðŸš¨ New Feedback Received
- **Embed**: TravelCost App Feedback
- **Fields**:
  - ðŸ‘¤ User: {uid}
  - ðŸ“… Date: {date}
  - ðŸ“± Platform: {userAgent}
  - ðŸ”¢ Version: {version}
  - ðŸ’¬ Feedback: {feedbackString}
- **Footer**: TravelCost App â€¢ Feedback System
- **Color**: Green (#00ff00)

## User Notes

- This is the first Cloud Functions implementation in this project
- Discord webhooks are much simpler than Signal CLI setup
- No server/container needed - just Discord webhook URL
- Mobile notifications work automatically with Discord app
- Ensure proper error handling since this affects user experience
- Test thoroughly with real feedback submissions before going live
