# Add Delete Trip Option

## Problem/Goal
Users need the ability to delete trips. This requires careful database analysis and implementation to handle all data relationships and edge cases.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Analyze database schema to identify all trip-related data connections (expenses, categories, users, etc.)
- [ ] Design deletion strategy (hard delete vs soft delete with deleted flag)
- [ ] Implement database calls for trip deletion
- [ ] Handle multi-user trips - ensure all users get updated when trip is deleted
- [ ] Implement UI for delete trip option in manageTrips screen
- [ ] Handle edge case: user deletes their last trip (should show fresh user UX)
- [ ] Handle edge case: user deletes trip that was another user's last trip
- [ ] Test that no orphaned expense/category/user data remains after deletion
- [ ] Implement confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions
- [ ] Test real-time updates for other users when trip is deleted

## Context Files
<!-- Added by context-gathering agent or manually -->

## User Notes
Important considerations:
- If a trip had multiple users, everyone should automatically get updated on the trip deletion
- Consider keeping tripId with deleted flag vs complete removal
- After deleting last trip, user should see same UX as a fresh user (able to create new trip)
