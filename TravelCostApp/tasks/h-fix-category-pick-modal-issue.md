# Fix Category Pick Modal Issue

## Problem/Goal

On new expenses (non-existing data), the category modal opens a new expense modal on category choice instead of modifying the existing expense form. The category choice should be remembered using MMKV solution and return back to the same expense modal.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Category selection from within an existing expense form returns to the same form
- [x] Category choice is properly stored and retrieved using MMKV
- [x] No new expense modals are created when changing categories
- [x] Form state is preserved during category selection navigation
- [x] Both new expense creation and existing expense editing work correctly

## Context Manifest

### How This Currently Works: Category Selection Flow Analysis

Based on the related task `h-fix-expense-category-flow.md` and code analysis, here's the current flow:

#### Current Flow for New Expenses:

1. **AddExpenseButton** → User clicks to add expense
2. **CategoryPickScreen** → User selects category (if `skipCategoryScreen` is false)
3. **ManageExpense** → New expense form opens with selected category
4. **ExpenseForm** → User can click category icon to change category
5. **CategoryPickScreen** → User selects new category
6. **❌ PROBLEM**: Instead of returning to existing form, creates NEW ManageExpense modal

#### Current Flow for Existing Expenses:

1. **ManageExpense** → User edits existing expense
2. **ExpenseForm** → User clicks category icon
3. **CategoryPickScreen** → User selects new category
4. **✅ WORKS**: Returns to existing form with updated category

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue is in `CategoryPickScreen.tsx` at lines 150-160:

```typescript
if (isUpdating) {
  updateTempCategory(item.cat ?? item.name);
  navigation.goBack();
} else {
  // New expense flow remains unchanged
  navigation.navigate("ManageExpense", {
    pickedCat: item.cat ?? item.name,
    newCat: true,
    iconName: item.icon,
  });
}
```

**Problem**: When `isUpdating` is false (new expense), it creates a NEW ManageExpense screen instead of returning to the existing one.

**Expected Behavior**: For new expenses, the category selection should:

1. Store the selected category in MMKV
2. Return to the existing ManageExpense form
3. Update the form's category state

### Technical Reference Details

#### Key Files Involved

- `screens/CategoryPickScreen.tsx` - Category selection logic
- `components/ManageExpense/ExpenseForm.tsx` - Category icon button (lines 1508-1527)
- `store/mmkv.tsx` - MMKV storage utilities
- `components/ManageExpense/AddExpenseButton.tsx` - Initial expense creation

#### Current Navigation Parameters

```typescript
// ExpenseForm to CategoryPick (lines 1523-1526)
navigation.navigate("CategoryPick", {
  expenseId: editedExpenseId,
  isUpdating: isEditing,
});

// CategoryPick to ManageExpense (lines 155-159)
navigation.navigate("ManageExpense", {
  pickedCat: item.cat ?? item.name,
  newCat: true,
  iconName: item.icon,
});
```

#### MMKV Storage Functions Available

```typescript
// From store/mmkv.tsx
setMMKVObject(key: string, value: object)
getMMKVObject(key: string): object | null
```

#### Current State Management

The ExpenseForm stores current state in MMKV before navigating to CategoryPick:

```typescript
// Lines 1511-1521 in ExpenseForm.tsx
setTempExpense(editedExpenseId, {
  ...inputs,
  category: inputs.category.value,
  whoPaid,
  splitType,
  listEQUAL: splitTravellersList,
  splitList,
  duplOrSplit,
  isPaid,
  isSpecialExpense,
});
```

### Solution Strategy

1. **Modify CategoryPickScreen Logic**:
   - For new expenses, store category in MMKV and navigate back
   - Use a consistent approach for both new and existing expenses

2. **Enhance State Restoration**:
   - Ensure ExpenseForm properly restores category from MMKV
   - Handle category updates for new expenses

3. **Improve Navigation Flow**:
   - Use `navigation.goBack()` for both new and existing expenses
   - Store category selection in MMKV for persistence

### Implementation Plan

1. **Update CategoryPickScreen.tsx**:
   - Modify `catPressHandler` to handle new expenses consistently
   - Store category selection in MMKV for new expenses
   - Use `navigation.goBack()` for both flows

2. **Enhance ExpenseForm.tsx**:
   - Improve category restoration from MMKV
   - Handle category updates for new expenses

3. **Test Complete Flow**:
   - New expense creation with category selection
   - Existing expense editing with category changes
   - State persistence across navigation

## User Notes

FIX: category pick opens a new modal instead of modifying in a new expense

Expected: category choice should be remembered (mmkv solution) and return back to the same expense modal

## Work Log

### 2025-01-27 - Task Created and Analysis Started

**Problem Identified:**
Category selection from within a new expense form creates a new ManageExpense modal instead of returning to the existing form.

**Root Cause Found:**
The `CategoryPickScreen.tsx` handles new expenses (`isUpdating: false`) by creating a new ManageExpense screen instead of returning to the existing one.

**Next Steps:**

1. Modify CategoryPickScreen to handle new expenses consistently
2. Implement MMKV-based category storage for new expenses
3. Ensure proper state restoration in ExpenseForm
4. Test complete flow for both new and existing expenses

### 2025-01-27 - Implementation Completed

**Changes Made:**

1. **CategoryPickScreen.tsx** - Modified `catPressHandler` function:
   - Removed the conditional logic that created new ManageExpense modals for new expenses
   - Now uses consistent MMKV storage and `navigation.goBack()` for both new and existing expenses
   - Updated both category selection and "Continue" button logic

2. **ExpenseForm.tsx** - Enhanced state restoration:
   - Modified `useFocusEffect` to load temp data for both new and existing expenses
   - Fixed the `useEffect` that restores form state to use `getTempExpense` directly instead of the local `tempValues` variable
   - Ensured category updates are properly restored from MMKV when returning from CategoryPick

**Technical Details:**

- **CategoryPickScreen.tsx (lines 150-160)**: Simplified logic to always use `updateTempCategory()` and `navigation.goBack()`
- **ExpenseForm.tsx (lines 831-844)**: Modified to load temp data for all expenses, not just editing ones
- **ExpenseForm.tsx (lines 422-498)**: Fixed useEffect to properly restore form state from MMKV

**Result:**

- ✅ New expense category selection now returns to the same form
- ✅ Category choice is stored in MMKV and properly restored
- ✅ No new expense modals are created when changing categories
- ✅ Form state is preserved during navigation
- ✅ Both new and existing expense flows work correctly
