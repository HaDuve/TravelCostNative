# FEAT: Add Pull-to-Refresh for Empty State in Expense List Screens

## Problem/Goal

Add pull-to-refresh functionality for empty states in both the RecentExpenses screen and the OverviewScreen charts container (ExpensesOverview). Include success/fail toast notifications with expense count and localized strings.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Add pull-to-refresh functionality to RecentExpenses screen when empty
- [x] Add pull-to-refresh functionality to OverviewScreen charts container (ExpensesOverview) when empty
- [x] Implement success toast: "Your Trip is up to date!" (0 expenses) or "Successfully synced X expenses" (X > 0)
- [x] Implement fail toast: "Failed to sync, please try again later"
- [x] Add localized strings for all toast messages in supported languages (en, de, fr, ru)
- [x] Ensure proper integration with existing refresh logic and offline queue
- [x] Test pull-to-refresh works correctly in both screens
- [x] Verify toast notifications show appropriate messages based on sync results

## Context Manifest

### Current Pull-to-Refresh Implementation

The RecentExpenses screen already has pull-to-refresh functionality implemented using React Native's `RefreshControl` component. The current implementation:

1. **RefreshControl Setup**: Lines 320-333 in `RecentExpenses.tsx` show the existing RefreshControl configuration
2. **Refresh Logic**: The `onRefresh` function calls `fetchAndSetExpenses` to sync data
3. **State Management**: Uses `refreshing` and `isFetching` states to control the refresh indicator
4. **Integration**: Already integrated with the existing expense fetching and offline queue system

### Current Toast System

The app uses `react-native-toast-message` for notifications with a custom configuration:

1. **Toast Component**: Located in `components/UI/ToastComponent.tsx`
2. **Configuration**: Custom toast config with success/error types and styling
3. **Usage Pattern**: `Toast.show({ type: "success", text1: "Title", text2: "Message" })`
4. **Localization**: Toast messages use the i18n system with `i18n.t("keyName")`

### Current Localization System

The app uses i18n-js with distributed translation instances:

1. **Translation Files**: `i18n/supportedLanguages.tsx` contains en, de, fr, ru translations
2. **Pattern**: Each component imports and creates its own i18n instance
3. **Usage**: `i18n.t("keyName")` for translated strings
4. **Fallback**: Automatic fallback to English when translations are missing

### Screens Requiring Pull-to-Refresh Enhancement

1. **RecentExpenses Screen** (`screens/RecentExpenses.tsx`):
   - Already has RefreshControl but needs empty state handling
   - Uses `MemoizedExpensesOutput` component for expense list
   - Has existing refresh logic in `onRefresh` function

2. **OverviewScreen** (`screens/OverviewScreen.tsx`):
   - Contains `MemoizedExpensesOverview` component (charts container)
   - Currently no pull-to-refresh functionality
   - Needs RefreshControl wrapper around the charts container

### Technical Implementation Details

#### RecentExpenses Enhancement

- The `MemoizedExpensesOutput` component already receives a `refreshControl` prop
- Need to ensure empty state triggers refresh functionality
- Current refresh logic in `onRefresh` function should handle success/fail states

#### OverviewScreen Enhancement

- Need to wrap `MemoizedExpensesOverview` with a ScrollView and RefreshControl
- Add refresh state management similar to RecentExpenses
- Integrate with existing expense fetching logic

#### Toast Notification Requirements

- Success messages: "Your Trip is up to date!" (0 expenses) or "Successfully synced X expenses" (X > 0)
- Fail message: "Failed to sync, please try again later"
- All messages need localization in en, de, fr, ru

#### Integration Points

- Use existing `fetchAndSetExpenses` function for data syncing
- Integrate with offline queue system for proper sync handling
- Leverage existing network context for connection status
- Use existing toast system for notifications

## Context Files

- `screens/RecentExpenses.tsx` - Main expense list screen with existing refresh
- `screens/OverviewScreen.tsx` - Charts overview screen needing refresh
- `components/ExpensesOutput/ExpensesOverview.tsx` - Charts container component
- `components/UI/ToastComponent.tsx` - Toast notification system
- `i18n/supportedLanguages.tsx` - Translation files
- `util/offline-queue.ts` - Offline sync functionality

## User Notes

Add pull-to-refresh for empty states with proper success/fail feedback and localization
