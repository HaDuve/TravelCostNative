# Task: Remove Notification Alert

## Priority: Medium

## Type: Fix

## Branch: fix/remove-notification-alert

## Description

Remove alert asking for Notifications since we are not using notifications anyway currently. This will clean up the user experience by removing unnecessary permission requests.

## Success Criteria

- Notification permission alert is completely removed
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- App continues to work normally without notification permissions
- Clean user experience without unnecessary permission prompts

## Technical Requirements

- Find and remove notification permission request code
- Remove any related notification setup code
- Ensure app doesn't crash or break without notification permissions
- Clean up any unused notification-related imports or dependencies

## Files to Investigate

- App.tsx - main app component
- Any notification permission request code
- Settings or permission-related components
- Push notification setup code

## Implementation Notes

- Look for Alert.alert calls related to notifications
- Check for permission request code (expo-notifications, etc.)
- Remove notification setup but keep other functionality intact
- May need to check if notifications are used elsewhere in the app
