# Task: Auto-fill Category Name as Description

## Priority: Medium

## Type: Feature Implementation

## Branch: feature/category-description-auto-fill

## Description

After choosing a category in the expense creation flow, if no expense description has been entered yet, automatically add the category name (translated) as the description text.

## Success Criteria

- When user selects a category and description field is empty, category name appears as description
- Category name should be properly translated based on current language settings
- This should work in the main expense creation flow
- User can still edit/override the auto-filled description

## Technical Requirements

- Integrate with existing translation system
- Work with current category selection logic
- Maintain existing UX patterns
- Ensure it doesn't interfere with existing description functionality

## Files to Investigate

- Expense creation screens
- Category selection components
- Translation/localization system
- Description input handling

## Implementation Notes

- Need to identify where category selection happens
- Find translation key mapping for category names
- Determine best place to trigger auto-fill logic
- Ensure it only happens when description is truly empty (not just focused)
